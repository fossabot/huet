This inconsistency may seem odd but\n        it's what allows for a simple and intuitive interface for picking\n        colors.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Picking colors for user interfaces poses a set of problems that you\n        don't see in traditional design work. If you changed an existing color\n        to a new one in in a print design, it's fairly straightforward to look\n        through your design and have confidence that a new color hasn't created\n        any issues. With apps, it's difficult even when you have a component\n        library or design system.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It's difficult to change existing colors for any of the reasons you\n        might want to:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Experimenting with a new look</li>\n        <li>Increasing accessibility</li>\n        <li>Differentiating modes and different parts of your app</li>\n        <li>Allowing users to customize their experience</li>\n        <li>Shifting your colors to adapt to an image or a logo</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        The rationale for having a comprehensive way of thinking about color\n        interactions becomes more clear if we think about various states and\n        modes as themes, or variations of existing themes. Sometimes we want to\n        apply \"themes\" to all or part of the UI. Some examples:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Dark mode</li>\n        <li>Admin mode</li>\n        <li>Incognito mode</li>\n        <li>Disabled state</li>\n        <li>Hover state</li>\n        <li>Selected state</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        Using Huet increases your flexibility in making large retheming changes.\n        However, it comes with an important limitation. It doesn't let you\n        specify whether a given element will be lighter or darker than its\n        background. The library will make that choice for you. I intend to make\n        this limitation as painless as possible over time.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Losing the flexibility to directly choose the lightness of your\n        component may seem like a big limitation, but it's' what makes Huet\n        possible. This means Huet may not be right for every project. Some\n        examples:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          You have relatively flat views. This means your visual heirarchy is\n          largely determined by size, spacing, and text color. EX: your\n          backgrounds are constistently some standard color throughout your\n          entire app (usually white).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          You have bespoke UIs where designers have enough time and control to\n          produce very polished designs.\n        </li>\n        <li>You have a simple app with few views.</li>\n        <li>\n          You have designers who have the time and ability to create a flexible,\n          focused pallet.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
